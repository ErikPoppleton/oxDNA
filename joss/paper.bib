	ABSTRACT={The oxDNA model of Deoxyribonucleic acid has been applied widely to systems in biology, biophysics and nanotechnology. It is currently available via two independent open source packages. Here we present a set of clearly documented exemplar simulations that simultaneously provide both an introduction to simulating the model, and a review of the model’s fundamental properties. We outline how simulation results can be interpreted in terms of—and feed into our understanding of—less detailed models that operate at larger length scales, and provide guidance on whether simulating a system with oxDNA is worthwhile.}

	abstract  ="To simulate long time and length scale processes involving DNA it is necessary to use a coarse-grained description. Here we provide an overview of different approaches to such coarse-graining{,} focussing on those at the nucleotide level that allow the self-assembly processes associated with DNA nanotechnology to be studied. OxDNA{,} our recently-developed coarse-grained DNA model{,} is particularly suited to this task{,} and has opened up this field to systematic study by simulations. We illustrate some of the range of DNA nanotechnology systems to which the model is being applied{,} as well as the insights it can provide into fundamental biophysical properties of DNA."

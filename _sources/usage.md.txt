# Usage

The compilation process will generate three executables in the `build/bin` folder: *oxDNA*, *DNAnalysis* and *confGenerator*. In what follows, mandatory arguments are enclosed by angular brackets, `<...>`, while optional arguments are enclosed by square brackets, `[...]`.

````{note}
All three executables take an input file as their first (mandatory) argument. Example input files can be found in the `examples` folder, while a more thorough description of the input file options and syntax can be found [here](input.md).
````

## oxDNA

*oxDNA* is used to perform the actual simulations.

```
oxDNA <input_file> [key1=value1] [key2=value2] [...]
```

The first argument, `<input_file>`, is the path to the file containing all the simulations' settings. It can be followed by a list of `key=value` pairs that overwrite the options found in the input file.

## DNAnalysis

*DNAnalysis* can be used to perform specific analysis on configurations or trajectories generated by *oxDNA*.

```
DNAnalysis <input_file> [key1=value1] [key2=value2] [...]
```

Here the usage is formally identical to `oxDNA`'s. However, note that the two executables handle some of the options found in the input file differently.

## confGenerator

*confGenerator* can be used to generate simple initial configurations. When used to generate DNA or RNA configurations it is recommended to always set `generate_consider_bonded_interactions = true` in the input file.

```
confGenerator <input_file> <box_size|density> [key1=value1] [key2=value2] [...]
```

In addition to the input file, *confGenerator* takes another mandatory argument which is interpreted as a number density if its smaller than 2 and as the length of the side of the cubic box otherwise.

# oxDNA

oxDNA is a simulation code that was initially conceived as an implementation of the coarse-grained DNA model introduced by [T. E. Ouldridge, J. P. K. Doye and A. A. Louis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3552946). It has been since reworked and it is now an extensible simulation+analysis framework. It natively supports DNA, RNA, Lennard-Jones and patchy particle simulations of different kinds on both CPU and NVIDIA GPUs.
